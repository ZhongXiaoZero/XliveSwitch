A Xlive Switcher plugin for Flutter

## Getting Started

This plugin is based on Oleg Frolov's animation design which I found on Dribbble:

Thanks Oleg Forlov for this beautiful design.

You can change the color of the switch follow by these attributes:
 - activeColor: background color when value is true
 - unActiveColor: background color when value is false
 - thumbColor: your thumb color
